## 🚀 What to Do Right Now (3 Options)

### Option A: Just Monitor (Recommended)
**Your training is running perfectly. Just let it finish!**

```bash
cd /home/ocean/MANTIS

# Watch progress (every 2-3 hours)
./run_training.sh --status

# Or watch live
tail -f logs/training/training_current.log
```

**Then:** Wait for completion (~8-10 hours), then follow `ACTION_CHECKLIST.md`

### Option B: Read While Waiting
**Learn the strategy while training completes:**

1. Read `FIRST_PLACE_GUIDE.md` (30 min)
2. Read `ACTION_CHECKLIST.md` (5 min)
3. Review `SALIENCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` (20 min)

**Then:** You'll be ready to deploy when training finishes!

### Option C: Prepare Deployment
**Get everything ready for deployment:**

```bash
# 1. Check your wallet details
echo "Wallet name: YOUR_WALLET_NAME"
echo "Hotkey: YOUR_HOTKEY_NAME"

# 2. Verify data is fresh
ls -lh data/*.csv

# 3. Test miner config
cat neurons/miner.py | grep -i "model_dir\|netuid"

# 4. Check system resources
nvidia-smi
df -h
```

**Then:** Deploy immediately when training finishes!
